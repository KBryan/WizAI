# Skill Creator Plus

An advanced framework for creating skills that **unlock AI agent capabilities** rather than constraining them to templates.

## Philosophy: Skills as Mental Frameworks

Skills are not checklists or templates—they are **mental frameworks that guide creative problem-solving**.

**Core principle: Unlock vs. Constrain**

| Constraining Approach | Unlocking Approach |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Rigid templates | Flexible frameworks |
| Strict rules | Guiding principles |
| Fixed outputs | Varied, context-appropriate results |
| Limiting choices | Expanding possibilities |
| Checklists | Mental models |

### The Three Pillars of Effective Skills

1. **Philosophy Before Procedure**: Establish "how to think" before "what to do"
2. **Anti-Patterns as Guidance**: What NOT to do is as important as what to do
3. **Variation as Requirement**: Explicitly prevent output convergence

**IMPORTANT**: This skill exemplifies the principles it teaches. Study its structure as a reference pattern for philosophy-first design.

---

## Before Creating a Skill

Ask these fundamental questions:

- **Purpose**: What procedural knowledge will this skill provide that the agent doesn't already have?
- **Philosophy**: What mental framework should guide decisions in this domain?
- **Triggers**: When should this skill be loaded? What specific use cases?
- **Scope**: Is this skill focused or trying to do too much?
- **Composability**: How will this work with other skills?

Good answers to these questions shape effective skills.

---

## Skill Creation Process

### 1. Understand with Concrete Examples

Skip only when usage patterns are already clearly understood.

**Gather examples of how the skill will be used**:
- Direct examples from users
- Generated scenarios validated by users
- Real-world use cases

**Key questions**:
- What functionality should this skill support?
- What would users say to trigger this skill?
- What are edge cases or variations?

Don't overwhelm users—ask progressively, not all at once.

### 2. Plan the Philosophical Foundation

**Before** planning scripts and resources, design the skill's philosophy:

**Establish the mental framework**:
- What philosophy guides this domain?
- What questions should be asked before acting?
- What principles help make good decisions?
- What mental model makes this domain intuitive?

**Identify anti-patterns**:
- What common mistakes happen in this domain?
- What should explicitly be avoided?
- What produces "generic" or "template" outputs?

**Plan for variation**:
- What should vary across outputs?
- What creates context-appropriateness?
- What prevents convergence on "favorites"?

See references/philosophy-patterns.md for frameworks to establish philosophical foundations.

See references/anti-patterns.md for common skill creation mistakes.

See references/variation-patterns.md for techniques to encourage output diversity.

### 3. Plan Reusable Resources

Based on concrete examples, identify helpful resources:

**Scripts** (`scripts/`):
- Code rewritten repeatedly
- Deterministic operations
- Complex, fragile procedures

**References** (`references/`):
- Documentation the agent should reference
- Schemas, API docs, domain knowledge
- Detailed workflows too long for SKILL.md

**Assets** (`assets/`):
- Templates used in outputs
- Boilerplate code, images, fonts
- Files copied or modified, not loaded into context

**Progressive disclosure principle**: Keep SKILL.md lean (<500 lines), move details to references.

See references/composability.md for designing skills that work well together.

### 4. Initialize the Skill

```bash
scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

Creates skill directory with SKILL.md template and resource directories.

### 5. Edit the Skill

#### Write the SKILL.md

**Structure (Philosophy-First Pattern)**:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: "Comprehensive description of what, when, and specific triggers. Include use cases and file types that trigger loading."
---

# Skill Name

[1-2 sentence introduction framing the problem/opportunity]

## Philosophy: [Core Mental Framework]

[Philosophy section establishing mental model BEFORE procedures]

**Before [acting], ask**:
- Question 1
- Question 2
- Question 3

**Core principles**:
1. Principle 1: [Why it matters]
2. Principle 2: [Why it matters]

## [Main Guidelines Section]

[Organized actionable guidance, grouped by category]

### Category 1
- Specific, actionable guidance
- Concrete examples
- Technical specifics when helpful

### Category 2
[More guidance...]

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Anti-pattern 1**: [Specific bad pattern]
Why bad: [Reason]
Better: [Alternative]

❌ **Anti-pattern 2**: [Specific bad pattern]
...

## Variation Guidance

**IMPORTANT**: Outputs should vary based on context.
- [Dimension 1 to vary]
- [Dimension 2 to vary]
- Avoid converging on [specific patterns to avoid]

## Remember

[Empowering conclusion that sets high expectations]
```

**Key guidelines**:
- ✅ Philosophy before procedure
- ✅ Explicit anti-patterns with examples
- ✅ Variation encouragement
- ✅ Organized by category
- ✅ Concrete over abstract
- ✅ Empowering tone

**Description field**:
- Include WHAT the skill does
- Include WHEN to use it (specific triggers)
- Include specific use cases
- 100-200 characters recommended

**AVOID**:
- ❌ Jumping straight to procedures without philosophy
- ❌ Only positive guidance (missing anti-patterns)
- ❌ Vague, generic advice
- ❌ No variation encouragement
- ❌ Over-specification (too rigid)
- ❌ Under-specification (too vague)

#### Implement Resources

**Scripts**: Test by running them. Ensure they work correctly.

**References**: Keep focused. One file per domain/topic for progressive disclosure.

**Assets**: Verify file formats are correct and accessible.

Delete unused example files from initialization.

### 6. Analyze Skill Quality

```bash
scripts/analyze_skill.py <path/to/skill>
```

Scores your skill on:
- Philosophy foundation (0-40 points)
- Anti-pattern prevention (0-25 points)
- Variation encouragement (0-20 points)
- Organization (0-10 points)
- Empowerment vs. constraint (0-5 points)

**Target score: 70+/100** for effective skills.

If score is low, run upgrade suggestions:

```bash
scripts/upgrade_skill.py <path/to/skill>
```

Provides specific improvements with examples.

### 7. Package the Skill

```bash
scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill>
```

Validates and packages into `.skill` file for distribution.

### 8. Iterate

After real usage:
1. Notice where the skill struggles or helps
2. Identify improvements needed
3. Update SKILL.md or resources
4. Re-analyze and re-package

---

## Skill Design Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy

Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines. Move details to references.

**Pattern: High-level guide with references**

```markdown
# SKILL.md
## Quick Start
[Essential workflow in 50-100 lines]

## Advanced
- **Complex topic**: See references/complex-topic.md
- **API reference**: See references/api-docs.md
```

**Pattern: Domain-specific organization**

```markdown
skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview + navigation)
└── references/
    ├── domain-a.md
    ├── domain-b.md
    └── domain-c.md
```

The agent only loads relevant domain file.

See references/workflows.md for workflow patterns.

See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns.

### Degrees of Freedom

Match guidance specificity to task fragility:

**High freedom** (text instructions): Multiple valid approaches, context-dependent
**Medium freedom** (pseudocode/parameters): Preferred patterns, some variation acceptable
**Low freedom** (specific scripts): Fragile operations, consistency critical

---

## Quality Heuristics

An effective skill should:

- [ ] **Establish philosophy** before procedures
- [ ] **Prevent anti-patterns** with explicit examples
- [ ] **Encourage variation** to avoid convergence
- [ ] **Match complexity** to domain needs
- [ ] **Empower, not constrain** - unlock capabilities
- [ ] **Organize clearly** by category or domain
- [ ] **Be context-aware** - adapt to situations
- [ ] **Provide specifics** - concrete over abstract
- [ ] **Stay concise** - lean SKILL.md, details in references
- [ ] **Compose well** - work with other skills

Run analyze_skill.py to check these objectively.

---

## Common Anti-Patterns in Skill Creation

See references/anti-patterns.md for comprehensive list. Key ones:

❌ **Template Trap**: Rigid templates that constrain creativity
❌ **Checklist Syndrome**: Rules without philosophy
❌ **Generic Guidance**: Vague advice that applies to everything
❌ **Context Blindness**: Same approach regardless of situation
❌ **Over-Engineering**: Too many rules for simple domains
❌ **Under-Engineering**: Too few rules for complex domains
❌ **Favorite Patterns**: Converging on repeated outputs
❌ **Missing Negative Guidance**: Only what to do, not what to avoid
❌ **Duplication**: Same info in SKILL.md and references

## Examples and Learning Resources

### Study Effective Skills

**Recommended skill to study**:
- **frontend-design** - Exemplary philosophy-first design

See examples/annotated/frontend-design-analysis.md for line-by-line analysis of why it works.

### Before/After Transformations

See examples/before-after/ for:
- **basic-to-effective.md** - Simple skill transformed with philosophy
- **procedural-to-philosophical.md** - From checklist to mental framework

These examples demonstrate the transformation pattern from basic to effective.

---

## Tool Usage

### analyze_skill.py

Analyzes skill quality and scores on key dimensions.

```bash
python scripts/analyze_skill.py <path/to/skill>
```

**Output**:
- Overall score (0-100)
- Category breakdown (Philosophy, Anti-Patterns, Variation, Organization, Empowerment)
- Specific feedback per category
- Recommendations based on score

**Use when**:
- After creating a skill
- Before packaging for distribution
- When improving existing skills
- To compare skill quality

### upgrade_skill.py

Generates specific improvement suggestions.

```bash
python scripts/upgrade_skill.py <path/to/skill>
```

**Output**:
- Priority-grouped suggestions (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Examples for each improvement
- Next steps guidance

**Use when**:
- Skill scores poorly on analyze_skill.py
- Updating an old skill to modern practices
- Learning what improvements to make

### quick_validate.py

Validates YAML frontmatter and basic structure.

```bash
python scripts/quick_validate.py
```

**Use when**:
- Before packaging
- After editing SKILL.md
- Checking syntax errors

---

## Composability Principles

Skills work together automatically based on descriptions. Design for composition:

✅ **Clear, specific scope** - One skill, one domain
✅ **Self-contained instructions** - Complete within domain
✅ **Orthogonal concerns** - Non-overlapping when possible
✅ **Flexible guidance** - "Prefer X unless..." not "Always X"
✅ **Test combinations** - Try multiple skills together

❌ **Don't reference other skills explicitly** - Breaks modularity
❌ **Don't create hard conflicts** - "Always X" vs "Never X"

See references/composability.md for detailed composability patterns.

## Differentiation from skill-creator

| Aspect | skill-creator | skill-creator-plus |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Approach | Procedural | Philosophy-first |
| Anti-patterns | Not covered | Comprehensive reference |
| Variation | Not mentioned | Explicit patterns and guidance |
| Quality analysis | Manual only | analyze_skill.py script |
| Examples | None | Before/after + annotated analysis |
| Composability | Not covered | Dedicated reference file |
| Self-improvement | No | Can analyze itself |
| Philosophy guidance | Implicit | Explicit patterns and frameworks |

---

## Remember

**Skills are mental frameworks, not checklists.**

The best skills:
- Establish philosophies that guide thinking
- Prevent mistakes through explicit anti-patterns
- Encourage context-appropriate variation
- Empower the agent to do extraordinary work

This skill exemplifies these principles. Study its structure, use the tools, and create skills that unlock capabilities.

**AI agents are capable of extraordinary work in skill creation. These guidelines illuminate the path—they don't fence it.**
